## 📝 Introduction

This project is a Node.js application that integrates the Zomato API with MongoDB using the Maka framework for enhanced data management capabilities. It enables the efficient retrieval and storage of restaurant data from Zomato.

## 🔨 Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB installed and running
- Zomato API key (Get one [here](https://developers.zomato.com/api))

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zomato-mongodb-maka-node.git
   ```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd zomato-mongodb-maka-node
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## 🔧 Configuration

You need to set up configurations for your Zomato API key and MongoDB connection. Create a `.env` file in the project directory with the following content:

```env
ZOMATO_API_KEY=your_zomato_api_key
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_uri
```

Replace `your_zomato_api_key` with your Zomato API key and `your_mongodb_uri` with the URI of your MongoDB instance.

## 🚀 Usage

1. Start the Node.js server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. The server will run at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

3. Use the provided API endpoints to interact with restaurant data.

## 📡 API Endpoints

- **GET /restaurants/:restaurantId**: Fetch restaurant details by ID.

  Example:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/restaurants/12345
  ```

<!-- Add more API endpoints and descriptions as needed -->

## 🗄️ Database

This project uses MongoDB for storing and retrieving restaurant data. Ensure that your MongoDB is properly configured and running.
